## SOLID

__S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle)__:- A class should take care of only one responsibility.      
   __O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)__:- Extension should be preferred over modification.
Usually it is a problem of __switch/case__ statement.      
   __L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)__:- A parent class object should be able to refer child objects seamlessly during runtime polymorphism.   
It means that we should avoid things like __method not implemented exception__ in child class.      
   __I stands for ISP (Interface segregation principle)__:- Client should not be forced to use a interface if it does not need it.
It is about versioning of interfaces.      
   __D stands for DIP (Dependency inversion principle)__:- High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction.
It means that all dependencies should be passed via constructor and should be interfaces.
